**Student ID:** 001183434  
**Final Year Project â€“ University Submission**

## Project Overview

This project delivers an end-to-end forex forecasting and trading signal generation system for the EUR/USD currency pair. It integrates multiple data sources, including historical market data, macroeconomic indicators, and news sentiment analysis. Using a modular Python architecture, the system applies advanced feature engineering, deep learning (LSTM models), and ensemble learning techniques to generate reliable forex price forecasts and actionable trading signals.

Key project components include:
- Multi-source data collection (OHLCV data, fundamental events, financial news sentiment)
- Advanced feature engineering and data preprocessing
- Multiple LSTM model training
- Ensemble learning with Bayesian optimisation
- Trading signal generation and backtesting
- Evaluation through statistical and financial performance metrics

**Important:**

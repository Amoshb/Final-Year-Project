# EUR/USD Forex Forecasting System  
**Student ID:** 001183434  
**Final Year Project â€“ University Submission**

## Project Overview

This project delivers an end-to-end forex forecasting and trading signal generation system for the EUR/USD currency pair. It integrates multiple data sources, including historical market data, macroeconomic indicators, and news sentiment analysis. Using a modular Python architecture, the system applies advanced feature engineering, deep learning (LSTM models), and ensemble learning techniques to generate reliable forex price forecasts and actionable trading signals.

Key project components include:
- Multi-source data collection (OHLCV data, fundamental events, financial news sentiment)
- Advanced feature engineering and data preprocessing
- Multiple LSTM model training
- Ensemble learning with Bayesian optimisation
- Trading signal generation and backtesting
- Evaluation through statistical and financial performance metrics

**Important:**  
> The complete source code has been submitted separately as required via Moodle.  
> For script descriptions and structure, refer to Appendix B in the final report.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, ensure you have all the required Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** If you have a compatible GPU, it is recommended to install TensorFlow with GPU support for faster model training.
> **Note:** MetaTrader 5 terminal must be installed and configured properly.

### 2. Prepare the Environment

Ensure that the following CSV files are available in the project root (or run data collection scripts if not):

- `Cleaned_EURUSD60.csv` â€” Historical OHLCV data
- `economic_calendar_data.csv` â€” Macroeconomic events data
- `dailyforex_eurusd_news.csv` â€” Financial news sentiment data

> ðŸ’¡ **Skip if already available:**  
> If all required data and pre-trained models are already present in the `with_test/` folder and data files are available, you can skip the data collection and model training phases.  
> You can directly proceed to running the ensemble and signal generation by executing:
>
> ```bash
> python ensemble_forex_trading.py
> ```

### 3. Data Collection (Optional if data is already prepared)

Run the following scripts to collect and prepare data:
```bash
python collect_ohlcv_data.py
python collect_fundamental_data.py
python collect_news_sentiment_data.py
```

### 4. Feature Engineering

After collecting data, process and generate features:
```bash
python feature_generation.py
```

### 5. Model Training (Optional if models are already trained)

Train the forecasting models:
```bash
python lstm.py
```

### 6. Ensemble Forecasting and Trading Signal Generation

Run the ensemble script to aggregate model predictions and generate trading signals:
```bash
python ensemble_forex_trading.py
```

### 7. (Optional) Baseline Model Evaluation

To compare baseline models:
```bash
python base_line_lstm.py
python svm_test.py
python xgboost_test.py
python static_learning.py
```

### 8. (Optional) Evaluate Pre-Trained Models

Evaluate existing trained models:
```bash
python model_eval_test.py
```
